      <p>But is that the framework of what art is? Most people like to associate art
        with the traditional art forms such as drawing, painting and sculpture.
        In modern times, however, art has rapidly changed form, thematic content and
        social functioning. But artwork is not just physical. Music can too
        for a part be an art form: sound organized in time to create enriching
        experiences through listening, dancing or performing. Philosophers and
        art historians have tried to create a common definition, but attempt to
        defining art has not corresponded to everything that is considered art.

      <h2 class="center_content2">What is Furry? </h2>
      <p>The furry community is a subculture that is characterized by a passion for
        anthropomorphic animal figures, which the participants often create and identify
        themselves with so-called "fursonas" – imaginative animal personalities that
        represent their own character traits and interests. These characters
        can be anything from classic animals such as wolves and foxes to more imaginative ones
        creatures like dragons and unicorns. The furry community has one
        range of activities and interests, including art, literature,
        costume design and social gatherings such as conventions and online forums. For
        Many participants are furry not just a hobby, but an important part of their
        identity and social life. Despite some misunderstandings and
        stereotypes related to the environment, there is a large environment that values
        creativity, self-expression and community.</p>

        <h2 class="center_content2">Art - More than just sculpture and painting</h2>
        <p>
          The furry community has a lot of what we consider art, where it is intertwined, with
           people who explore their passion for anthropomorphic animals through a wide spectrum
           of creative forms of expression. Painting and drawing are among the most popular
           the art forms within saub culture, and they are often used to create
           vivid and imaginative images of fursonas and other animal figures.
           The artists in this community explore different styles, from
           realistic portraits to more stylized and abstract works, and each
           artist puts his unique twist on his creations.

           In addition to traditional painting and drawing techniques, digital plays a role
           media an increasingly dominant role in the furry art world. Digital
           illustrations and manipulations allow greater flexibility and
           the ability to create intricate and detailed images that explore
           the boundaries between fantasy and reality.
          
           Images also play an important role within the furry community, and that
           is common for members to share their artwork through social media,
           websites and online galleries. These images provide not only a visual
           feast for the eyes, but also serves as a means of sharing and celebrating
           the community's creative talents and diversity.

          Fursuits represent a unique form of furry art
           where you create your own costumes from your fursonas or others
           animal figures. These costumes, which often include a head, tail, and
           fur suits, allow users to play their characters on
           public events such as conventions or parades. Each fursuit
           is a unique handmade masterpiece, created with care and dedication to
           reproduce the character's appearance and personality in a vivid way.
          
           Overall, painting, drawing, pictures and fursuits provide the furry community
           a rich and varied visual culture that celebrates imagination and creativity
           to its members in a unique and colorful way.
